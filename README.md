# Forge

Install forge (client, choose your `%appdata%\.minecraft\` game directory and install it)

You need this version of forge: [forge for minecraft 1.14.4](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.14.4-28.1.0/forge-1.14.4-28.1.0-installer.jar)
	

### Super quick forge setup to make this all easier:

- install forge (above)

- open launcher
- go to installations tab
- create a new one
- name it minecraft.micahtmusic.stream so its easier to remember
- select the game version from the list named release `1.14.4-forge-28.1.0`
- save and close the launcher
- download all the mod jar files and put them in `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods` directory (just create it if it doesn't exist, as long as you already installed forge)

From now on you can pick minecraft.micahtmusic.stream from the launcher versions list, or click Play from the installations tab



# Known issues

### red X

I can't install xaeros minimap on the server, so if you have it installed at the client, it will show a red X before you join.

Minimap **still works** though! Even if it is just installed on the client.

Once they fix the mod for 1.14.4 it will likely go away.
